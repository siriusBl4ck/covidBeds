The purpose of this app is to be an informative dashboard with a decentralized source of information. 
Anyone can view the dashboard to get information about the current availability of COVID beds in their city.
Each COVID hospital can have an account, linked with their email and a secure password (which can be changed if necessary). Account creation is by the authority which will (could) maintain this app, in order to avoid manipulation of the public and misinformation.
Each hospital is responsible for updating its bed count, multiple times a day if necessary. In order to encourage frequent updation, the dashboard displays when each hospital updates it's data. Hospitals forging their data can be detected more easily via this functionality.
Since each hospital is wholly responsible for its own data, this can encourage hospitals to be more accountable, as their image is at stake if they do not update the data.
Giving hospitals the responsibility also prevents manipulation of data by any one authority.

Future ideas which can be implemented include integration with Google Maps so a potential patient can access directions to their nearest COVID hospital which is not beyond capacity. This will discourage crowding in some hospitals. It will also save time of the doctors, who in my experience have to literally phone call the doctors in other hospitals in order to ask them if they have capacity for patients.
